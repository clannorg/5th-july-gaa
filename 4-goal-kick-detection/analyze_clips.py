        You are an expert GAA analyst watching a 15-second clip starting at {timestamp}.

        GOAL: Detect OFFICIAL KICKOUTS and analyze the complete tactical sequence.

        GAA KICKOUT SEQUENCE ANALYSIS:
        1. TRIGGER: What caused the kickout (ball goes out of play)
        2. SETUP: Players clearing goal area and spreading across field  
        3. KICKOUT: Goalkeeper places ball on ground, kicks from stationary position
        4. CONTEST: Players running toward ball to win possession
        5. OUTCOME: Who wins possession, where, and what happens next

        OFFICIAL KICKOUT CRITERIA:
        ‚úì Complete play stoppage after ball goes out of play
        ‚úì Players deliberately CLEAR the goal area (crucial GAA behavior)
        ‚úì All outfield players SPREAD across field in anticipation
        ‚úì Goalkeeper places ball on GROUND (never from hands during active play)
        ‚úì Clear PAUSE before kick (not immediate clearance)
        ‚úì Players contest for possession after the kick

        DO NOT DETECT:
        - Goalkeeper clearances during active play
        - Kicks from hands without play stoppage
        - Quick kicks without proper player positioning
        - Any kick when players haven't cleared the area

        TEAM IDENTIFICATION (by jersey colors):
        - Goalkeeper and outfield players wear different colored jerseys
        - Note specific colors you observe for each team
        - Team A (Cork): Often yellow/amber/red combinations
        - Team B (Kerry): Often green/gold/white combinations

        **ENHANCED OUTPUT FORMAT:**
        KICKOUT: [YES/NO]
        CONFIDENCE: [1-10] (how certain are you this is an official kickout?)
        
        IF KICKOUT = YES, provide:
        TRIGGER_EVENT: [What caused it - shot wide/shot over/goalkeeper save/defensive clearance]
        EXACT_CONTACT_TIME: [X.X seconds into clip when goalkeeper's foot touches ball - be precise to 0.1s]
        KICKING_TEAM: [Team A/Team B based on goalkeeper jersey]
        PLAYER_POSITIONING: [Did players clear area and spread out? YES/NO]
        
        KICK_ANALYSIS:
        KICK_DISTANCE: [Short/Medium/Long - how far did it travel?]
        KICK_DIRECTION: [Left/Center/Right of field]
        KICK_ACCURACY: [On target to players/Off target/Contested]
        
        POSSESSION_OUTCOME:
        POSSESSION_WON_BY: [Team A/Team B/Contested/Unclear]
        POSSESSION_LOCATION: [Where caught - Left/Center/Right, Near/Middle/Far field]
        NEXT_ACTION: [What happened after catch - Shot/Pass/Retained/Lost possession/Unclear]
        
        JERSEY_DETAILS:
        TEAM_A_COLORS: [Describe jersey colors you see]
        TEAM_B_COLORS: [Describe jersey colors you see]
        GOALKEEPER_JERSEY: [Color of kicking goalkeeper]
        
        TACTICAL_CONTEXT: [Describe the full sequence - what led to kickout, how players positioned, who won possession, immediate outcome]

        IF KICKOUT = NO, provide:
        REASONING: [Why this is not an official kickout - active play/no positioning/etc.]

        REMEMBER: GAA kickouts are highly structured events where players must clear the area and position for the contest. Look for this specific tactical behavior.
