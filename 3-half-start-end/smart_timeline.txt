At 00:10, the referee clearly performs the **GAA throw-in ceremony**, bending their knees and throwing the ball high into the air between two opposing players who are positioned to contest it. This action is the official signal that starts the period of play.
- **00m15s**: -   **CENTER CIRCLE ACTIVITY:** This is the most critical indicator present. Both teams are moving to and arranging themselves around the center of the field. This action is unique to the start of the first half, the start of the second half, or the start of extra time.
