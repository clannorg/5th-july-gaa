# 🕐 Half Start/End Detection

AI-powered detection of GAA match periods using video analysis.

## 📋 Overview

This module analyzes video clips to detect:
- **Match Start**: First kickoff with throw-in ceremony
- **First Half End**: Players leaving field for halftime
- **Second Half Start**: Second kickoff after halftime break
- **Match End**: Final whistle and players leaving permanently

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Analyze Video Clips
```bash
python analyze_clips.py --clips-dir ../clips --output-dir results/descriptions
```

### 2. Synthesize Timeline
```bash
python synthesize_patterns.py --input-dir results/descriptions --output-file results/timeline.txt
```

### 3. View Results
- **Final Timeline**: `../match_timeline_final.json`
- **Detailed Analysis**: `results/timeline.txt`

## 🎯 Key Features

- **GAA-Specific Detection**: Recognizes throw-in ceremonies, player positioning
- **Temporal Logic**: Validates timeline consistency
- **Evidence-Based**: Provides detailed reasoning for each detection
- **Parallel Processing**: Fast analysis with configurable threads

## 📊 Output Format

The analysis produces:
1. **JSON Timeline** (`../match_timeline_final.json`) - Clean, structured results
2. **Detailed Analysis** (`results/timeline.txt`) - Full reasoning and evidence
3. **Individual Descriptions** (`results/descriptions/`) - Per-clip analysis

## 🔧 Configuration

Key parameters in `analyze_clips.py`:
- `--threads`: Parallel processing (default: 8)
- `--max-clips`: Limit clips for testing
- `--clips-dir`: Input video clips directory

## 🎯 Detection Criteria

### Match Start
- GAA throw-in ceremony in center circle
- Referee throwing ball up between two players
- Transition from warm-up to organized play

### Half End
- Players walking to sidelines
- Break in active gameplay
- Team gathering behaviors

### Half Start
- Players returning from sidelines
- Throw-in ceremony restart
- Organized positioning for play

### Match End
- Final whistle
- Players leaving field permanently
- No subsequent active gameplay

## 📈 Accuracy
